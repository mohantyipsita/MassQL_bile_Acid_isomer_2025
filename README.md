# MassQL_bile_Acid_isomer_2025
This repository contains scripts and data files used in the generation of figures and spectral library for the study using MS/MS fragmentation-based MassQL filters to differentiate bile acid isomers. 

Figure 1. **Development of MS/MS Fragmentation-Based MassQL Filters. **
a) Structure of bile acids highlighting mono-, di-, and tri-hydroxylated steroid cores, with experimentally observed potential hydroxylation sites on the steroid core indicated by red stars. b) MS/MS fragmentation spectra of the regioisomers, taurochenodeoxycholic acid and taurodeoxycholic acid, illustrating a low-intensity mass region containing ions unique to each isomer. c) Enlarged view of the MS/MS fragmentation spectra for taurochenodeoxycholic and taurodeoxycholic acids, emphasizing the ion pair used to calculate relative intensity ratios for differentiating these isomers. d) Sequential MS/MS fragmentation-based filtering tree designed to classify regio- and stereoisomers of dihydroxylated bile acids. Structures at each filtering step are shown, with terminal bins color-coded for clarity. e) Retention time and MS/MS analysis confirmed the MassQL tree-predicted core structure of the bile acid conjugate, deoxycholyl-putrescine by comparing with a synthetic standard.

Figure 2.** Discovery and Validation of Deoxycholyl-2-Aminophenol in Biological Samples.**
a) Distribution of bile acids (n=776; bile acids with more than 2-fold change from the total 929) between small intestinal fluid and fecal samples. b) Assignment of the bile acid steroid core by MassQL queries and putative identification of the modification using high-resolution MS1 data. c) Validation of deoxycholyl-2-aminophenol through retention time matching in biological samples using the synthetic standard. d) Peak area abundances of deoxycholyl-2-aminophenol before and after anti-inflammatory ITIS diet intervention. e) Peak area abundances of deoxycholyl-2-aminophenol before and after MIND diet intervention. f) Percentage of participants with non-zero peak area abundances of deoxycholyl-2-aminophenol. A non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for the boxplots in Figures 2d and 2e. Horizontal lines indicate the median value, the first (lower) and third (upper) quartiles are represented by the box edges, and vertical lines (whiskers) indicate the error range, which is 1.5 times the interquartile range.
